# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/24/2023 (Week 1)
## Junyan Du (Jenny), Technology Design Foundations

### Summary: 

This week, through using Rhino and Grasshopper, I utilized TDF Computational Design project files to produce a phone stand for myself to document in the course.
I made adjustments in Grasshopper regarding my phone size, table height, and my height to best fit my usage of this phone stand. Then I export to file to Adobe Illustration and then Laser Cut the file out with Plywood. The final result fits my phone well, and works great filming myself. 

Here is the Final Result:

</p>

### Reflections:

I first Measured the height and width of my phone (with phone case):

<p float="left">
  <img width="45%" src="weekly-reports/Week 1/Measure.1.jpeg" />
  <img width="45%" src="weekly-reports/Week 1/Measure.2.jpeg" /> 
</p>

Next, I adjusted in Grasshopper to have the Phone Size, Table Height, and my Height customized to myself.

Then Bake the Joined vector:

Here's how it looks in Rhino:

<p float="left">
  <img width="45%" src="weekly-reports/Week 1/Process.R1.png" />
  <img width="45%" src="weekly-reports/Week 1/Process.R1.png" /> 
</p>

Afterwards, I exported the file into Ai and set it to the required file settings for Laser Cut:

<img width="45%" src="weekly-reports/Week 1/Process.A2.png">
<img width="45%" src="weekly-reports/Week 1/Process.1.JPG">

Finally, Put the pieces together and it fits my phone well!

I really enjoyed doing this project, and I quite struggled at the beginning since I am not that familiar with Grasshopper. I took me a while to figure out the logic in Grasshopper and how to adjust the measurements.

### Speculations:

It currently fits my phone very will and can clearly film a video in selfie mode. This can be very helpful in documenting in the future. 
I also look forward to my it more suitable for different situations, for example, an adjustable height.
